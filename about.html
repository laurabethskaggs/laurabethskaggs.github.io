      <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Laura Skaggs Bowling — a project manager, business analyst, and AI practitioner based in Baton Rouge. I lead complex modernization efforts in state government, blending deep domain knowledge with a hands-on technical approach.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past six years, I’ve led large-scale initiatives across licensing, education, case management, and financial systems. My sweet spot is turning ambiguity into action: translating regulatory requirements into working software, aligning technical and business teams, and managing delivery from roadmap to rollout.
</p>
<p>
  My AI work spans training LLMs, designing conversational agents, auditing model outputs, and guiding prompt engineering strategy. I bring structure to experimentation — whether it’s refining task quality, developing evaluation rubrics, or validating model behavior in real-world use cases.
</p>
<p>
  I work fluently across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, and bring a systems-thinking mindset to every project. Whether it’s mapping legacy workflows, optimizing user experience, or analyzing data patterns, I focus on building solutions that make impact obvious.
</p>
<p>
  When I’m not solving problems with tech, I’m probably reading about them — from AI policy to plant physiology. I believe the best systems are built by the most curious minds. <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-skaggs78/" target="_blank">Let’s connect</a>.
